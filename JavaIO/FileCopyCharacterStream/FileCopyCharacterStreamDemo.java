/*
ðŸ§ª Task:
Write a program that copies the content of a text file (source.txt) into another file (destination.txt) 
using character streams.

Requirements:
Use FileReader and FileWriter.
Read character by character (or in a buffer of chars).
Handle exceptions properly.
Print a confirmation message after copying.

Improvement Suggestions

Direct Streaming (More Efficient):
Right now, you read everything into memory (StringBuilder) before writing.
For large files, this is not scalable.
Instead, write directly while reading:

int data;
while ((data = sourceContent.read()) != -1) {
    destinationContent.write(data);
}


This removes the need for StringBuilder.
ðŸ”¹ Your version is still correct â€” but think in real-world backend apps: we avoid unnecessary memory use.


Buffer-Based Copy (Next Step):
Character-by-character is fine for learning, but buffered copy is much faster.
Example:

char[] buffer = new char[1024];
int charsRead;
while ((charsRead = sourceContent.read(buffer)) != -1) {
    destinationContent.write(buffer, 0, charsRead);
}

This reads/writes chunks instead of single characters.



Optional Polish:
If file doesnâ€™t exist, you could add a check for source.exists() and show a user-friendly message.
For debugging, printing content is good, but in production, weâ€™d skip printing the full file content to console.
