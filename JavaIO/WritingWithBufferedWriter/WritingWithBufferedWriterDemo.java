/*
üß™ Task:
Write a Java program that creates a file named buffered_message.txt and writes 
the following three lines into it using BufferedWriter:

Java I/O is powerful.
Buffered streams improve efficiency.
Always close your resources.


üîç Requirements:
Use BufferedWriter (wrapped around a FileWriter).
Write multiple lines, each ending with newLine().
Use try-with-resources for safety.
Print a confirmation message once done.
